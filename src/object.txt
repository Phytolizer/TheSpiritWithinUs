/*
Original code by Ruud Helderman ("How to program a text adventure in C")
For the game "THE SPIRIT WITHIN US" Alessandro Ielo added:
.explanation: obj->description is used to describe the whole scene and obj->explanation to name individual objects.
.originalLocation: defines the original location of the object (check misc.c)
.power: the amount of food energy (check executeEat in inventory2.c).
.animal: defines whether an object is an animal (check damage.c).
.sector: defines the sector on the map of a location (check fire.c).
.burn: defines whether an object can burn (check fire.c).
.weapon: the number of weapons carried by the player (check move.c).
.light: defines whether a location is lit (check misc.c).

emptyRoom is used in several functions, to delete and recall objects from the map.
      (check damage.c, fire.c, misc.c, toggle.c, executeEat)
