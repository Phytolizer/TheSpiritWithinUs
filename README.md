# TheSpiritWithinUs

THE SPIRIT WITHIN US is a text-based psychological thriller & exploration game in C with four different endings based on the choices made during the game, leaving the player to decide the best course of action.

THE SPIRIT WITHIN US follows natural rules. The player has only one life, and when the energy level reaches zero the player dies and the game ends.
It integrates a simple but effective "verb-noun" parser and a manual.

PLEASE NOTE: Due to the nature of the contents, this game is NOT suitable for children.

A personal note.

During the 2020 lockdown I started studying the C programming language and at the end of my course I wanted to create a game to test my newly acquired skills.
I used Ruud Helderman’s "How to program a text adventure in C" tutorial as a base, which I expanded to make the game more to my taste.

THE SPIRIT WITHIN US is my first C project and my first text adventure in general, but it's a complete and solid game that I hope you will like.
