THE SPIRIT WITHIN US, the manual.

**** Introduction ****

Interactive fiction is a story in which you are the main character.
Your own thinking and imagination determine the actions of a character and guide the story from start to finish.
To move from place to place, type the direction you want to go.
When you begin your adventure, it's a good idea to become familiar with your surroundings by exploring every location and reading each description carefully.
As you explore, it is helpful to draw a map of the geography.
In addition to exploring you will have to make choices that will lead to one of the possible endings.


**** The Parser ****

When you see the prompt (-->) on your screen, the game is waiting for your command. Type the command after the prompt and hit the ENTER key.
	1. To move from place to place, just type the direction you want to go: north (or n), east (e), south (s), west (w).
	2. The game understands many different kinds of sentences, mainly in the verb-noun form, however combinations like "turn X on" or "put X in Y" are also possible.
	3. One-word commands, such as "inventory", give you specific information.
	4. Some commands have abbreviations to make the game run more smoothly, as g for get/take, l for look or x for examine.
	5. Traditional commands are "look", "go", "get/take", "put", "open", "unlock", but the game recognizes many more that the player will have to discover.

Here is a partial list of commands recognized by the parser:
	.look / look around / look X / look at X / examine X
	.go to X / go X\n   .take X / get X / hold X
	.drop X / put X in Y
	.give X to Y
	.open X / close X / lock X / unlock X
	turn on X / turn off X
	.hit X / attack X / hit X with Y / attack X with Y / kill X
	.defend / protect / parry
	.eat X / read X / drive X / burn X
	.inventory / help / info
	.wait / quit


**** Save and Recall ****

THE SPIRIT WITHIN US follows natural rules. The player has only one life, and if the energy level reaches zero the player dies and the game ends.
The game can be interrupted and resumed as many times as you want, thanks to the save file.
To save and recall the game:
	1. At the beginning of the game you will be asked to enter a name for your save-game file.
	2. If the save file does not exist, it will be created automatically.
	3. To resume your game, enter the save-game file name the next time you access the program.
	4. If you want to play the game again from the beginning, simply create a new save file.
